To run the game start the application named ReachVolume.
When prompted press play. (You may select screen resolution and windowed mode if you so choose)

Once in game there is a button in the lower left hand portion of the screen called "INSTRUCTIONS",
it will explain how to navigate through the game progression.

All data is located in your "Documents" folder (usually C:\Users\User\Documents\) in a folder named "ReachVolumeGame".
Reports are generated and saved in a subfolder of "ReachVolumeGame" named "Reports". They are named by using the User's ID and the date/time when it is generated.
You can go through the reports to find a report from a previous session.

Reports are created when you press the "QUIT" button after a trial. A word document is created, saved, and opened in the background. To access the new report quit the game and there should be an open word document that is the report for the user that just played.
